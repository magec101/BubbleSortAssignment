## Bubble Sort

Use the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. 
Remember that you need to nest the loops so that you can iterate over the integers in the array. 

The possible scenarios that you need to be careful about include passing 
an empty array, or an array containing negative integers. 

When you are done with the development, you can run the test cases provided to validate
that the code is working fine before submitting the code.
